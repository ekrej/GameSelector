A little project I started to test out multiple C# GUI frameworks.
Its a simple application that allows you t o fill in a list of items an choose a random entry from it.

the frameworks teste are:

 - UWP 
 - Avalonia
 - WPF

The projects were made in the order listed above. 
Every project uses a similar layout, but I tried to change the styling here and there to keep things fresh.

There also was an attempt to use the Uno framework. However, Uno uses the WPF or UWP controls, depending on the developers preference, for the Windows version of the app.
This would mean that the Uno version is just another version of one of these frameworks. 
Since this project scope doesn't go outside of Windows it wouldn't make much sense to make an Uno version, if its going to be identical or very similar as 2 of the other versions.
