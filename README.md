A little project I started to test out multiple C# GUI frameworks.
Its a simple application that allows you t o fill in a list of items an choose a random entry from it.

the frameworks teste are:

 - UWP 
 - Avalonia
 - WPF

The projects were made in the order listed above. 
Every project uses a similar layout, but I tried to change the styling here and there to keep things fresh.
